# OpenGov Data Challenge – Africa's Civic Innovation Hackathon

## Executive Summary

The OpenGov Data Challenge is a continent-wide digital hackathon designed to empower students, developers, and innovators across Africa to transform open government data into real civic solutions. By connecting young talent with governance transparency challenges, this program builds a sustainable ecosystem of open-data-driven innovation while advancing OpenGov Africa's core mission of accountability and citizen participation.

---

## Problem Statement

**The Gap:** While open government data exists across Africa, it remains underutilized due to:
- Limited awareness of available data sources
- Lack of technical capacity to process and visualize data
- Missing bridge between young innovators and real-world governance challenges

**The Opportunity:** Africa has a growing community of talented developers and students eager to apply their skills to social impact, yet they often lack structured platforms to contribute to transparency and accountability.

**Our Solution:** A hackathon-style program that connects open data, civic issues, and young innovators through mentorship, collaboration, and recognition.
