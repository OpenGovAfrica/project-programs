## Overview
The Civic Tech Data Fellowship is a six-week program designed to empower local journalists, civic activists, and university students across Africa to access, clean, analyze, and visualize government open data relevant to their specific city or region. It aims to turn raw public data into actionable local stories that drive accountability.

---

## Problem Statement
- **Lack of Localization:** Public data exists but is complex, poorly documented, and not tailored to local contexts.  
- **Skill Gap:** Local actors lack data analysis and visualization skills.  
- **Low Accountability:** Data remains unused, reducing its power to hold authorities accountable.

---

## Goals & Objectives
- **Objective 1 (Skills):** Train 20 fellows per cohort in essential data cleaning and visualization.  
- **Objective 2 (Data Access):** Localize and map at least five public datasets in each participating city.  
- **Objective 3 (Accountability):** Publish 10 data-driven stories on government spending or service delivery.  

**Long-Term Goal:** Build a network of civic technologists who continue monitoring governance independently.

---

## Target Audience
**Primary:** Local journalists, community organizers, civil society leaders, university students (Data Science, Political Science).  
**Secondary:** Open data advocates and government transparency officers.
